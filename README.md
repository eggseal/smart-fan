# Smart Fan Project

This program allows the connection and monitoring of a smart ventilation system using Ubidots and a ESP32 via MQTT protocol
 *   When the temperature goes above a threshold of 25Â°C the motor will begin to rotate, the on/off state and temperature are monitored by the dashboard indicator
 *   The velocity in which the motor rotates is controlled by the dashboard slider 
 *   The whole system can be brought to a halt using the pause switch on the dashboard

 The purpose of this project is to be a practical example of the connection of an IoT device with a real IoT platform
